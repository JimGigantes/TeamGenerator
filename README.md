# TeamGenerator
   
  ## Description

  This project is a node.js generator. It prompts the user to list personal information (Name, Email, Role, along with a few other data points) of team members. After the User has listed all of the memebers of the team they can then enter the name of the HTML file to be created. The generator then takes all of the given information and prints out a HTML file with bootstrap styled cards. There is a card for each of the team members
